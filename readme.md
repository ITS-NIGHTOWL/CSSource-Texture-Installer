## How to install
1. Download the zip file [here](https://github.com/ITS-NIGHTOWL/CSSource-Texture-Installer/releases/download/1.1.0/installer.zip).
2. Extract the ZIP file and run the executable inside called `cssource-installer.exe`.
3. Wait until the installer gets to the prompt asking `Would you like to start installing the CSSource textures?`. Press `y` on your keyboard.
4. From there, the installer should automatically start downloading the needed dependecies such as `steamcmd`. Everything from this point is automated, so as long as your computer doesn't automtically go into rest mode, feel free to let it do its thing for 5-10 minutes (time may vary depending on connection speeds)
5. After the installation is finished, the installer will automatically clean up after itself, from which point you are free to delete it off your computer or save it for later use if for whatever reason your textures get messed up or you want to share the installer with a friend.
